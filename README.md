# Customer Segmentation
## Overview
- Built a model using the K-means clustering algorithm to cluster customers with similar interest 
- The Model is trained on data collected from a well-known e-commerce website over a period based on the customerâ€™s search profile.
## Data Cleaning 
- Columns with Null Values are treated.
- Checking the count of gender, and treating the missing values.

- The Silhouette Score was evaluated for the quality of clustering results to get the optimum value.
- After getting the optimum K value use it as the number of clusters and perform the model fit.
