# Customer Segmentation
### Overview
- Built a model using the K-means clustering algorithm to cluster customers with similar interest 
- The Model is trained on data collected from a well-known e-commerce website based on the customerâ€™s search profile.
### Data Cleaning 
- Columns with Null Values are treated.
- Checking the count of gender, and treating the missing values.

- The elbow method is a graphical method for finding the optimal K value in a k-means clustering algorithm.

- The Silhouette Score was evaluated for the quality of clustering results to get the optimum value.
- After getting the optimum K value use it as the number of clusters and perform the model fit.

- The model will provide the output of different clusters.
- Analyzing each cluster to get insights.

### Insights

- Cluster 0 has the Lowest past orders but has the most searches, whereas
- Cluster 1 has the Highest past orders and average searches and at last
- Cluster 2 relatively has the Average past orders and average searches.

- Cluster 0 has done the most number of searches with 81477 searches.
- cluster 1 has done 64573 searches.
- Cluster 2 has done the least number of searches with 60093.
